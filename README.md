# Weather-Showing-App
<h3>It is a Django Application made by me. </h3>
<p>It has simple two pages </p>
<ol>
<li>Location Collection Page</li>
<li>Weather Information Showing Page</li>
</ol>
<p>It collects the location of which weather to be shown. It uses api for this work.</p>
<p>After collecting locatino it sends its longitude and latitude to the another api which tells about the weather at that coordinates.</p>
